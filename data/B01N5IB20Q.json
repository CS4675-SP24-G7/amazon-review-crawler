      "title": "The reviews don't tell the whole story",
      "content": "Basically, this drive works for 90% of people. But for 10%, it has some huge issues. Before I go into the technical details, let me preface it with a simple statement: no other SSD has this unique set of compatibility issues. None. I've never seen a firmware reject various system configs in such a way since SSD's went mainstream with the Intel X25-M in 2009. So as you might guess, this drive has firmware issues. To Kingstons' credit, they have attempted (numerous times) to correct it. I can tell there have been at least 4 revisions. Note: the drives I received from Amazon in November 2019 have the latest firmware. The issue for Kingston is they inherently shot themselves in the foot trying to support this drive. Kingston has been notorious, most famously with the A300, for changing components in drives without relabeling them. Everything from NAND brands and type to complete controllers. The A400 suffers the same issue, so they are dealing with a compounded situation of firmware bugs across a variety of specifications. Which is why they can't completely fix it for ALL drives, because the fixes don't apply to ALL drives. Now that alone has scared people off the brand, and it should scare you away too. Who would buy a product with said specifications when they are likely to receive something entirely different? Well, that's the Kingston way, and it is in plain sight because in Kingston fashion: they NEVER list specifications for their products other than performance. Kingston never reveals the controller, cache package, NAND brand or type, or overall reference design. Because they are well aware they plan to change it based on what is available to them for their packaging budget. Now that I'm done rightfully thrashing Kingstons' business ethics, onto the drive. I ordered 6 of these: (2) 480GB and (4) 240GB. I can say the 480GB is less problematic. But one was problematic and two 240GB drives were unusable. On the other hand, two 240GB drives installed perfectly and run fine to this day. The problem machines: Dell Vostro 260 Pentium G630 (H61 chipset seems to bring out a SATA LPC bug) and any AMD chipset seems to have a SATA bug as well, as reported in various forums around the web. So basically avoid putting these drives in older machines that are NOT SATA3 (6Gbps) or any AMD PC. Well, that eliminates the majority of the target audience for an entry level drive. Verified working PC's: HP Elitebook 840 G1 (laptop H81 variant) and Dell Inspiron 15 5000 (recent Intel 8th Gen Pentium - probably 370 series chipset variant) Behavior: <HDD transfer rates reading\\writing - doesn't matter if SLC flushes, transfer rates are still horrible. The malfunctional SATA link causes the system to stall randomly, for 10-60 seconds at a time while the drive attempts to flush a stalled queue. You know its a SATA link error because the HDD light blinks or even goes near solid. If the SLC were dumping, garbage collection were occurring of the controller were bogged down, you WOULD NOT see SATA activity for this. This drive should be pulled from the market. UPDATE 9/26/2020 A 240GB drive failed today less than a year into service in a very light-use office PC. Lenovo T30 circa 2010 Workstation with a X58 chipset. Probably retiring the PC, due to overall age, but the drive got us to that point, not the other components which still serve the roll as a basic office PC in a warehouse handling shipping labels and timeclock software. Should never have gambled with these drives. Fortunately the machine was entirely backed up to the cloud using Backblaze.",

      "title": "Problems from start, cascading into complete hardware failure within two and a half months",
      "content": "I should have dug into the reviews in more detail here: some reviewers are giving a surprising number of stars despite reporting short lives and other failures for these drives. Meanwhile, my experience has been closer to that of the other 1 star reviewers here: drive started to fail virtually from day one, but in ways so subtle that I could not at first be sure that the system issues were not purely derived from a faulty install.  By the time I could be certain the problems were with the drive itself, it was too late: when used as a boot drive, crashes began to happen hourly and attempts to back up the contents of the drive were fruitless and frustrating as I/O errors prevented easy or comprehensive copying of data, whether the drive was being used to load a system or was being accessed from an external OS. Ultimately the boot sector and partitions became undetectable, and not even a read of the raw data via recovery software was possible.  Most peculiar of all, the diagnostics software I used to test the drive as part of my recovery efforts suggested the drive had four times the the Power-On Hours as should have been possible for the amount of time I had owned it--though of course its not impossible this was an artifact of the software. Regardless, in just over 10 weeks, the drive was a brick and I had failed to recover all of its contents, despite a huhe investment of time and effort. Now normally, with most any product I would like to give the manufacturer and opportunity to replace the defective product and re-secure most of the stars of a review.  But as this drive was used for work and I have an ethical obligation to protect the data of my clients, I can't just mail away a drive, even if I could overwrite the data (which would have been impossible in this case regardless).  Add in the fact that an SSD is a product one usually opts for in part for system stability and the headaches that issues from this defective product and I feel I have no choice but to leave this review at one star.  Though in truth, I should have known better: I was vaguely aware of the reputation of Kingston SSDs and should not have allowed myself to be seduced by the price here. I will certainly have this lesson in mind as I shop for a replacement.",

I prefer Crucial software because they have a downloadable Acronis software that all was work for me.  I have used Kingston Memory many times without issue.  I saw on Amazon that Kingston  SSD's also provides Acronis software for cloning.  I ordered a 480 GB hd, it was a little cheaper than crucial but it was a little smaller and the size was not critical.  The software Kingston recommended me to download  from Acronis installed but registration didn't  work. On Saturday Dec 5 contacted both companies unsuccessfully.  Kingston Never emailed or called. I contacted both Acronis and Kingston for assistance. I contacted Acronis.  Thank you for contacting Acronis Customer Central. My name Kashyap. This is a follow-up email post the chat conversation we had earlier. You had contacted us as you were unable to register the license which you received from Kingston. During the course of conversation, I informed you that Acronis True Image OEM version is not a product under Acronis and unfortunately, we do not support for the OEM product. Then I contacted Kingston. Thank you for submitting your service request with Kingston Technology. Our Technical Support department will be contacting you within the next 48 business hours. Please also note that our hours of operation are M-F 6am-6pm. Your service request number is SR1275936. Please keep this number as you will need it as a reference number when contacting Kingston about your request. Please wait for an Email response from the technician. Any replies to this Email will go unanswered. I cloned the hard drives using Miray Software, without issues. I can not recommend Kingston SSD's if you need their software or support because they did not support me.",

Controller sensor shows about 49 grad celsius. Maximum temperature that I've seen (measured via laser thermometer) near the M2 slot in the Kingston's capacitors is 61 grad celsius. Well.. Verdict.. If you don't care about promissed writting speed from kingston, maybe this cheap version is the best. But if you plan to use it frequently in file transfering from one device to another, maybe 100MB/s is very slow for you.  Anyway I'm not satified.",

Now, a couple of years later, drive number 2 has also thrown in the towel. Given that I've dealt with Kingston support on a different product and they were less than helpful beyond \"Return it to Amazon\", I'm not even going to bother reaching out to them this time. Thankfully, drive 2 was just for storing 3D materials, base meshes, and other assets that can always be re-downloaded, but to have yet another one of these fail combined with the issue I had with their performance RAM has officially turned me off from their products for good. I used to buy exclusively Wester Digital drives before I got my first SSD, so it looks like that's where I'll be going from now on.",

I even could not format it, since the format process was failed in the middle. I mounted this drive to Linux machine and performed partitioned benchmark, and got errors in write access. My conclusion was that it is not operable any more. I bought new one (Samsumg 860 EVO) and was able to install the WinOS with no problem. Hopefully is will last longer.

Also, I found that Kingston drives don't have very good longevity, as can be seen from many other reviews saying their drive died after a few months.

Yes, I have it working; that said, on a functional bootable drive I automatically get a menu asking which OS to boot.

After getting it up and running, I noticed that after a few minutes of the computer being online it would hard crash with a solid orange light on the motherboard. This happened three times before I swapped the old HDD back in, and what do you know, it worked perfectly again. I'm very glad I didn't erase my original drive.

I was able to copy the files off of the drive, but I had to use a live environment on a USB disk and deal with the SSD in question failing several times during the process. The drive was very hot to the touch. Several weeks after I replaced it, I plugged it into an external bay and it lasted for some time without overheating and disappearing from my drive manager. The PC I removed it from is now running a WD HDD without any trouble. Thankfully, its still under warranty, so I should be able to get a replacement. A word of caution for potential buyers: on parts and storage mediums, look for old reviews. This product got insanely popular very quickly, but few of the reviews showed long-term performance details when I got it.",

Mind you I have been fixing computers for decades and know what I am doing. So I installed a fresh OS on it. And it loaded fine when using a sata to usb cable. But when I plugged it into my MacBook internally, it stopped working. Infact the MacBook does not even POWER ON! I spent countless hour on YouTube and forums and tried every single solution (even directly trying to power on the MacBook through the power pads on the logic board). So I took the ssd back out. Installed my original HDD to the MacBook and it still doesn\u2019t power on. So then, I connected the ssd to my other Mac, through usb to sata cable and it\u2019s not even loading up. I feel like this ssd killed my MacBook by killing itself in the PROCESS. What a let down. Now I have to figure out how to fix my MacBook. WILL  NOT  BUY FROM KINGSTON AGAIN.",

I tried all the fixes I could and attempted to install new software to no avail... If you do get this drive you're going to experience hiccups in speeds tremendously..

Retrimming did not solve the problem and chkdsk doesn't show anything wrong with the drive.  At the very least it is taking the files, albeit incredibly slowly.

Both tested new, on the same config & OS (same cable, SATA port, OS state, etc).  The bad one is so slow individual writes take nearly 1s in some cases (600-900ms -- I'm running a real-time monitor). The slow one is 4-10x faster, but still far slower than my slow, cheap 6 year old Crucial SSD that is nearly aged out. In the SAME position doing the same test. Not much of a refresh... (one A400 bought in 2021, one bought in 2022 so they have different firmware, different batches of NAND, etc). Maybe a firmware update would help? But it won't add DRAM or replace the poor-reputation controller. And ALSO, that firmware update requires Windows-- which doesn't exist in my house. Nope! As for benchmark numbers, maxing out controller speeds? Nope. Don't even dream it. Every spinning SATA drive in my house was faster than these Kingstons. I should have read topic-oriented forums beforehand, where the Kingston drives are widely panned even amongst other cheap models with no DRAM buffer.  (NB: the \"yay I upgraded my archaic laptop it's so much faster\" reviews aren't really a good baseline) Two stars instead of 1 since one drive did work, and was faster than a thumb drive. If not by much. I have fond memories of Kingston as a premium tech brand in the 1990s and early 2000s (yes, I've been doing technology for that long). But today, there's a reason these are so much cheaper than the competition. And c'mon, the bad one should not have passed QA. Typically once a drive is assembled, it's briefly tested before being sent for packaging. Apparently they didn't, or did so briefly that the slow-as-IDE drive didn't get flagged. Bad QA. Hard Pass unless you're trying to make your compute environment worse.",

After some work to get 7 installed, I was off and everything worked perfectly until early July 2019 when windows completely locked up.  I waited for a while to see if it would auto correct itself but it didn't.  Upon rebooting the drive wasn't recognizable as a boot drive.  Booting using a jumpdrive with linux installed I could see the drive but the partitions were gone and I couldn't create any partitions.  The Windows Installation CD for 7 also couldn't partition the drive.  This was pretty catastrophic a failure as I hadn't backed up my financial database for two months.  Thankfully I at least had a backup to rebuild from, though it took nearly  a day to get things back to current.  What a mess.  I'm not trying to warn anyone away from an SSD.

I am using only 25% of the total drive capacity. In the beginning I thought about virus or malware but I cleaned the PC and there was no improvement. I know that with the use, the ssd performance degrades and this is taken in account by other fabricants like Crucial that offers the software Crucial Storage executive.

As part of the process I used one PC, a Debian 11 Live CD and the dd command to write urandom data filling each disk.  Of a stack of disks, eight had a performance of 142-146 MB/s.  Three had a performance of 80-81 MB/s.  After noticing such a distinct difference, I repeated the test with the same results.  Additionally, it is the newer disks (higher serial numbers) that are slower.  The bad three are in the sequence of KINGSTON_SA400S37120G_50026B7782E1XXXX.  I have one backup in unopened package in the same sequence which I fear will also be slow. Overall I liked the disks, but the performance of the new disks has me looking elsewhere.",

My Western Digital can write a 48GB transfer in about 3 minutes and 20 seconds, with a sustained write speed of 220MB/s.  The exact same transfer, from the exact same source drive, took 12:30, with a sustained write speed of about 55MB/s.  For just a few more dollars, you can purchase a Western Digital or Samsung and get a 400% speed increase. Or, even better, jump up to an NVME drive and achieve 800% improvement.

Luckily, I still had a previous install of Windows 10 on another drive as a fail safe in case something went wrong. So glad I did. Now, the SSD will not format. It keeps throwing a Data Redundancy Error message which means it's dead. Luckily, Amazon is making it easy for me to swap it out for a new or get full refund. I'm doing the refund. Maybe I just had bad luck, but I'm also not the only one with this issue. I could have just swapped it out with the same one, but I'm going to review more carefully and try to find another one that appears to be more stable. It's a shame too. Kingston is a good name and I had hoped the other reviews I saw where people were having issues were either wrong reviews, or just outliers. But for some reason, I'm in that camp now. Just beware, but if you do get it directly from Amazon, they're pretty cool about refunding or swapping out. I had a normal SATA HDD that was going bad (Windows reboot was slow, Firefox would take 30+ seconds after launch before it would respond to keyboard commands). So decided it was time to get an SSD. I had issues getting it to be recognized by WIndows 10 and the reason was I had to update the AHCI driver via device manger. Once it updated it and I rebooted, it was there. After that, I was able to boot up the latest Windows 10 version (1903) from a USB card and the install went very fast (less than 20 minutes from start to finish). Once that was completed, after a reboot, Windows 10 has returned back to being snappy. Less than 30 seconds from reboot to log in, as well as Firefox launches within seconds and I can immediately start typing in it and it responds. Yes, 240gb is not a lot, but I plan to use this as my system/boot drive only and not data storage. The speed increase I see from this drive is phenomenal. Would buy another one when it's time for a larger SSD to replace my aging SATA HDD. My system itself is old (AMD Phenom X4 at 3.2ghz) but this hard drive has breathed new life into it that it feels like a brand new system like it was over 10 years ago when I first built it. Since this is the bare bones drive, it didn't come with the Kingston software and no instructions, but for someone like me who has built his systems since the early 90's, I didn't need a lot of hand holding.",

After it happened for the third time in a month today, I checked the SMART status and saw that it has already had 23 \"reallocation events\" and \"SSD Life Left\" is now 8 out of 100, with the note \"Notice: The drive has less than half of its estimated life left.\"  (I checked the status of my other drives, including one absurdly long-lived WD HDD that has 12.6 years of \"power-on\" time, and none of them have any reallocation events.) I checked the warranty... The good news is that it's covered for 3 years from the date of purchase, but the bad news is that the drive has to deteriorate to the point that \"SSD Life Left\" is 1 out of 100.  According to SMART, \"0 means insufficient reserved blocks, drive may be in read-only mode to allow recovery of the data.\"  In other words, the warranty will kick in when the drive has deteriorated past the point where it can't be trusted to hold anything I care about.  I guess it'll work as a simple operating system drive, since I can always just reinstall my OS on another drive when it flakes out entirely.",

I managed to get a comfortable 240 MB/s in sequential read and a solid 30 MB/s in random read. Faster than a mechanical drive, but if you intend to get the best loading performance, you might want to search for faster options. For me, the pricetag makes this an excellent choice, but for someone that doesn't know much about SSDs and shops for brand, it might be misleading.",

It is usually as simple as putting the 2 hard drives in the cloning device and pressing a button.  Because of the partitions and software that appeared to be on the drive it refused to clone to it even after I put it in the laptop and partitioned it.  I eventually had to use the cloning device as a USB connection to the laptop and download some free software for cloning since Kingston does not included cloning software.  If you plan to use a cloning device look at other SSD's as this one will fail.  So far the speed seems good however I have only had it installed for about 24 hours.

And you can't get a KEY. I used Clonezilla which is truly FREE although it does not have a user-friendly interface like other paid cloners. So the option is to pay $35 for this drive and then another $40-50 for cloning software OR get a Samsung for $10 more that comes with excellent cloning software which they call \"migration\". Other brands like WD may have good, FREE software, too. I'm using the drive which works very well - as good as others I have. I learned a lesson with this brand depending on how it's used.",

Cloning as I'm writing this. The failing drive however, failed about 5 minutes in. Amazon is replacing the drive as well as having the failed one picked up by UPS. I checked the status of the replacement though, and it's showing TWO units shipped to me for $0.00. I only said in the online chat with Amazon rep. that one had failed. I found no option for me to update the number of items being replaced. Will have to include a note in the return package.

As an upgrade over the 6 year old 7200 HDDs it was amazing (though anyone why knows about pcs could tell you that.) Boot times went from over 2 minutes per PC to literally about 10-15 seconds! Also I can open programs right away instead of letting the pc idle a few minutes before even attempting. The reason I don't give a perfect rating is I personally know Kingston as a budget drive manufacturer that may cut corners to keep prices down. That doesn't mean they exactly make bad drives, but that I wouldn't trust this drive with irreplaceable data. For that I favor Samsung. That aside I still would of gave it 4 stars but they don't include any type of drive cloning software meaning unless you have some already you could be spending hours and hours trying to do a drive swap that should take minutes as was my case. Once again that is why I like Samsung, they include a drive cloner that works with their drives amazingly. The fact the company doesn't offer that at all for these drives is a joke. You want more happy Customers Kingston, then start including some.",

The Crucial drive comes with cloning software that is easy to use and effective. All is not lost, however.  Although this is listed as an internal drive, the case is sturdy enough to use as an external drive without purchasing a separate enclosure.  All you need is a SATA to USB cable and a spare USB port on your device, and you are good to go. I am using a StarTech cable that supports USB 3.0 and everything works like a charm. For the price and the capacity this is a decent deal if you are looking for extra storage. If you are thinking about cloning, though, look elsewhere. Make sure that whichever brand that you get comes with bundled software. A number of other brands, including that one that I ultimately purchased for the cloned drive, come with OEM versions of an app called Acronis True Image. The bundled version will only work with the brand of SSD that it comes with, but for replicating a drive for safety, upgrading, etc. it works well.",

Ran Crystal Benchmark then right after my computer became unresponsive and I was getting 150kb/s read and write. The drive wasn't overheating tried other SATA cables the unresponsiveness kept happening RAM,CPU, and GPU were operating fine. Swapped back to my old HDD and no issues since. Buying a new SSD but going with a different brand. Judging by the mostly positive reviews from people that have had this SSD for a while I will give Kingston the benefit of the doubt and I think my individual SSD was just bad (it happens) but because of the issues though I would not recommend this SSD to someone. I gave it a 3 star review because when it did work it worked just like advertised.",

Installing Windows was all fine, until when I went to create a System Image on a recovery partition on the SSD (I made a C: and D: drive on the same SSD).  However, to test reliability of a restore - I went to test this and after doing a System Image Restore, sometimes the first boot up of Windows after the restore would encounter heavy FAT table corruption that results in scan disk to run during boot up and fixing tons of allocation table errors.  This actually was so severe, that after the restore I had to wipe out the SSD and re-install Windows all over.  I figured out that it was actually failure of the SSD during the System Image backup phase, when writing the FAT table somewhere during backup, the write failed so the restore was using corrupt FAT table data.  I spent 2x amount of time on re-installing Windows to make sure I had a good backup image on each of the three laptops.  You get what you paid for!!",

For the laptops I had no issues, simply cloned the existing slow-as-molasses drive, removed it and inserted this SSD - worked like a charm and lots of kudos from the owners of how fast their old machines have suddenly become. In 2 years I had only one faliure and that after 16 months on a Macbook pro. The desktop (i don't like working on desktops - for some reasons I always end up with a cut requiring band aids) is a gaming desktop. The owner uses it for FSX (flight simulator) and he was amazed at the performace. Simply loves it. I actually want to give this 4.5 because the capacity could be better. It is not the fastes SSD but it is IMHO reliable and great for swapping out those old laptop hard drives.",

All they said was how I had voided any warranty by opening up the computer. Amended review: Tried aomei cloning software and it worked perfectly. It was also free and didn't require the registration hassle that acronis did. The SSD is very fast and has boosted the performance of an old netbook to a good usable level. Don't waste your time trying to use the furnished cloning software. It doesn't work and you cannot get any worthwhile support. I would give acronis a -5 stars and PNY a +4 stars. I'm docking PNY 1 star for not knowing anything about the cloning software they furnished. The SSD itself is great.",

I have SSDs from other brands in desktops that are pushing 8 years of 24x7 service (and mechanical drives in 24x7 service also way longer than 3 years). So lifetime is the measure of \"good\" for this review. These drives are, purportedly, an older design lacking some features that would improve speed and reduce wear (yes, SSDs wear), and likely also use a chip technology that has a lower life to begin with (life is really determined by how many writes the chips can tolerate, which is what causes \"wear\" in this technology). So, maybe not so good. But, pretty fast, and definitely cheap. In my opinion, they are a great product for a system you expect to have a limited overall life, perhaps as an upgrade for an older computer to get more speed and extend its life/your investment a couple more years. But, make sure my backup game is strong if you use them (shouldn't you always?). And when it fails, remember what you paid for it.",

Just velcro it or zip tie it somewhere inside the case. There are no moving parts and it doesn't get hot. So, it's really hard to damage the device. After moving the OS over to this drive, my boot times were dramatically improved. And I mean dramatic! I had a problem where my virus scanner would take several minutes to fully launch on a restart (bit defender). With this installed, the computer fully boots and finishes its quick scan in less than 2 minutes. The programs I have installed on the load crazy fast. Best way to breath some life in an older workstation!",

Highly recommended for the price, but if you also receive a \"not detected\" error, where it's not even showing in the BIOS, and you happen to have the luxury of a working computer, trying attaching it there and initializing the drive first.",

Microsoft office is ~1-2 Gb which will leave you with 73 or so Gb to play with. I'm using this for a word processing machine for my parents so the size is just fine (I kept the old harddrive in place for extra storage) I'm a software developer and I set up/tear down project frequently so I could easily build 10 Gb of garbage a week. If this is something you're familiar with, pay $15 extra for the larger drive! Does not come with the SATA cable or a power cable (for those installing into a desktop) so you'll need to make sure you buy those separately if necessary.

I contacted Kingston warranty and submitted a picture of my Amazon purchase only to find it was denied. It showed when I would receive the drive not the two days previous that I placed the order with Amazon. I have resubmitted the very first day the order was placed,and hope Kingston support will not find fault with that also. We will see. 1/28/19 I have not heard back from kingston support. I sent another e-mail asking if the device was passed or rejected. Edit: On 1/29/19 Kingston restored my faith in their name by issueing an RMA for the defective device.Thank You",

By doing that, and with a fresh OS install, machines that were almost unusable due to the slow boot and poor general performance got back to work just fine. My sister could not believe the performance boost in her laptop with such an small investement. Now she will keep it for a longer time, which is good for her pocket, and for the environment. It's not the fastest drive (more like a low to mid level performace comparing to other ssd) and the SATA III standard is getting phased out by newer/faster Pcie Nvme drives. The price also has been going up lately, which is not great for drives of this size/capacity. So in conclusion, if your computer supports the newer m.2 pcie nvme drives, go get one of those, but for older machines with aging hdd, go get one of these. It's the best investment you can do to give a breath of life in and old computer. Have a nice day...",

      "content": "Be warned if you are considering buying this A400 to replace HDD - may not be as simple as it seems, with this model, Kingston fails to include or provide any support/access to any cloning software so I'm dinging them for this. I've wasted over 40hrs trying to get this to work, used the Macrium product to replace an HDD by setting up this new A400 SSD which now will not boot.  Running Windows 8.1 on an ASUS Q500 laptop.  Both SDD and HDD are GPT, UEFI boot, AHCI, about 235GB of space used, SDD capacity 500GB, HDD capacity 700GB.  I first tried to create Macrium clone but kept getting ambiguous Macrium message \"error 0\" after it would run for hour or so even after I did the suggested hours long chkdsk /f.  Next I instead used Macrium to successfully create image of my ASUS HDD (all partitions - that took about 3hr) and then restore the Macrium image of my ASUS HDD (all partitions) to the new SSD (Kingston A400) connected via USB cable - took about 2hr to restore.  Upon completion, was able to use file explorer and visually spot check that all files including system, hidden seem to have been moved to new SSD.  Shut down pc, removed HDD, installed SSD, rebooted and was sent straight into BIOS which showed the SSD under SATA connections but did not show it under boot selections.  Based on info found on other forums, turned off drive security in BIOS, rebooted, same result back into BIOS.  Used the Macrium Bootable USB Flash Drive I'd made prior to start, rebooted to that flash drive, ran the \"Fix Windows Boot Problems\" Utility which seemed to run successfully.  Removed USB flash and rebooted.  Still went straight to BIOS. At least now the new drive showed in BIOS under bootable devices/boot selections. Rebooted to Macrium flash drive and from command line for the SSD boot drive c:, ran bootrec /fixmbr and still same result.  Also tried /fixboot and /rebuildbcd but SSD drive still will not boot, laptop just goes to BIOS.  Used windows to make a repair/bootable USB and tried to repair the SSD, still would not boot. Went back to old drive, used windows to make system image, put SSD back in and booted with repair USB and tried to restore image by connecting via USB the old HDD containing windows system image but windows would not find the system image even though I could go to a command prompt and see it.  Now trying to download Windows 8.1 ISO to try installing that on the SSD but little faith at this point. Unsure how I will get past this and get my SSD to boot, may return it. UPDATE: upgrading to 4 stars, originally rated as 2 stars partly because when I contacted Kingston support for help, they suggested drive was defective out of box and I should return it.  I finally did get it working with Win 8.1 fresh install and it is working great, definitely faster than old HDD. Who knows whether problem was with my old HDD (causing clone failure) or Macrium software itself - bottom line Kingston should include clone software and support as they do with some of their other drives.",

Definitely improved my PC\u2019s performance and I\u2019m happy with it. Original review: When I received it, I noticed that the SSD itself was crushed in and there was a bit of scratches on the back. I didn\u2019t think much of it since it could just be the housing, but upon installation I couldn\u2019t fit the SATA cable into place. I had to take needlenose pliers and pry it open to fit the cable, but even then the SSD refused to read properly on my PC. It keeps saying \u201cUnknown\u201d \u201cNot Initialized\u201d when trying to make a partition in Disk Management; it cannot read that the hard drive is actually there and I cannot find a proper workaround that actually works no matter how many times I try to physically reinstall the drive.

      "content": "Expected more! OK, it is a SATA 3 solid state drive, but barely loads a little faster than my Seagate mechanical drive. I bought the low cost one just to test its performance in a single board micro ATX setup and expected a little more from a solid state. Granted, it is not the latest technology and the price is right (maybe not?). OS loading time compared to my 2.5\" Seagate is a little faster, however my Seagate has 500GB of storage, at approximately the same cost. Fazit, it does not improve system performance by a great deal e.g. exchange a KIA with a Porsche, is not what you'll get. More like a KIA with Hyundai! No offence meant to KIA and Hyundai owner! The only and probably best thing about this device, is the mechanical robustness. For example in a Laptop, that gets abused by some user, it will keep your data safer and corruption by mechanical abuse is virtually impossible. Well, it could, but depends on the distance of a free fall!!! *** The laptop, gets probably destroyed before the drive *** The technology that this storage device is based on, should provide reliable service for the coming few years. I'll see if this statement is true! Other than that, installation is very easy, since you simply swap the existing mechanical SATA with this one. Connection scheme is the same and connectors are compatible with SATA 3 drives. My Debian Linux 9.0 had no problems to recognize it and was ready out of the box, however, I opted to do a fresh install via CD ROM, instead of an OS transfer. The CD had the driver for the device and there was no problem to put the OS onto this (should I call it a drive?) device. That is all I can say about it at this time. Update: Forgot to tell my comparison results, which mean little to me on the keyboard or screen. I did compare (maybe not fair) this device with a WD black 2.5\" mechanical drive, installed into a USB 3.0 portable case. The read data transfer is about 10 times faster as the WD, according to the benchmark. Sorry, but these numbers are only to make me feel good, since I already stated, it does not feel much faster. To be fair, I only wanted it to boost performance a little in a Micro ATX dual core Intel D525, so it may produce significantly different numbers on a high end computer.",

Which is what I did for 2 out of the 3 years that I've owned it. Why? Because... I didn't know that the drive was the problem. I've got it installed in the Ultrabay in a Thinkpad T440p, and I thought THAT might have something to do with it. I didn't realize that this was the problem until I was doing some research on new drives and saw one of the random techie reviews say this one is NOT a boot drive. Honestly, I would've returned it if I had known that the drive was the culprit sooner (just because it isn't usable for what I wanted it for and I had no other use for it), so I'm letting ya'll know that before anyone else makes my same mistake. I'm docking one star for an inaccurate product description. All that said... if you aren't buying it to put an OS on (or you don't care about going into the BIOS every time, I guess), it's a great drive! It's still going strong even after three years, and it's pretty fast.",

      "content": "While this product is very much an entry level SSD using a DRAMless design, if you have an older secondary system that may have been using an 80-120GB SSD (such as the older SATA 2 ones from intel, OCZ and other companies), then this SSD offers a noticeable performance boost. I used this to replace a failed SDSSDH-120G-G25 120GB Sandisk ultra SSD, which was used as the main system drive for a media center PC. The process to restore was quite fast, as I only needed to restore a system image from my weekly backups. Details about the drive: I am unsure of variations in production, but the unit I received, details the following for the controller and NAND. While I have not personally experienced, it, some people have complained about the company changing hardware while keeping the same model number so long as the hardware meets or exceeds advertised specs. If this holds true, then it can mean the potential for variation between devices received, but the combination of Controller and NAND that I received, has worked well Controller: Phison PS3111-S11 NAND: Toshiba 15nm TLC NAND Strengths: Great read performance: Tasks such as bulk transfers (datasets that do not need a very high IOPS), would hover around 500-540MB/s. From my initial stress testing before using it as a system drive for the media center PC, I used it as a secondary game drive for 2 days, trying games such as Ark Survival Evolved, and The Witcher 3. For load times, performance was in line with higher end drives such as my Samsung 850 Pro, thus showing that games that are not IO intensive, do not need a very high end SSD to get great load times. Decent write speeds for a DRAMless TLC drive: Write speeds are slower due to the DRAMless design and small process node TLC NAND. If copying a single massive file e.g., 20+GB video, you can expect speeds in 450MB/s range, but if you are simply copying a folder with mixed files, such as a folder of image files in the 15-30MB range, will drop to the 280-350MB/s range. The peak speeds you see in most synthetic benchmarks are only achievable on linear reads or linear writes. Low temperatures: One benefit to lower end SSDs, is they do not generate much heat. Even when installed on the SSD mounts located behind the motherboard tray (where there isn\u2019t much ventilation), the drive peaked at 30C during a stress test, even though the ambient temperature in the room was 23C Weaknesses: Large drop in performance compared to higher end SSDs, when it comes to high IO mixed workloads, such as if an application such as a screen recorder video editor using it as a scratch disk. You can have as little as 15MB/s worth of high IOPS writes (many tiny writes), and it will take linear reads down from the 500-540MB/s range, down to the 350MB/s range, wall while having no CPU bottleneck (no signs of the process scheduler using 100% of CPU time from any o the cores). This is common for all DRAMless drives where they struggle with mixed workloads. It still handles these tasks better than any of the older SATA II based SSDs that I have used, but it is much slower than modern MLC NAND SATA III SSDs with DRAM onboard. The use of 15nm TLC NAND will mean that write endurance will be low on these drives. This is perfectly fine for users who will mostly be doing reading such as using the drive for game installs, or as a system drive for a computer where you will not be working with many files on the SSD. In my case, since the media is stored on a NAS, the SSD will see very little in the way of writes. The 240GB model is rated for 80TB of writes over the life of the drive. This basically means that it would be a bad choice for write intensive workloads. This ultimately reduces the versatility of the drive, but as long as you understand the limits, and thus make an informed decision, this is a great value for an SSD.",

But the system software install was painless and the SSD works perfectly.  Very perceptible increase in boot speed and read speeds, quiet, and I imagine my battery life is a bit better too. Be aware, there is no disk copying/cloning software (Crucial does offer this). Also the drive did not come with a spacer.  It is 7mm and I had a 9mm space to fill in my older laptop.

      "title": "A great way to upgrade performance on an older laptop",
      "content": "A good friend of mine gave her old laptop to me. It's a 15.4 inch Toshiba Satellite A135-4487 64 bit system. This computer was new in 2006 or so, and it came with Windows Vista, DVD/CD burner, Centrinio dual core 1.66mhz processor, 4 gb of ram, and two hard drives. I installed my copy of Windows 7 Pro 64 bit on its new Kingston 240gb SSD, as Toshiba still has Windows 7 drivers available. Boot up is now in just a few seconds and program loading is blazingly fast. I have since ordered another Kingston SSD to replace the second hard drive in this computer. Some important facts about upgrading from traditional spinning hard drives to solid state drives (SSD). The biggest bottle neck on any computer is the data throughput between the system and the hard drive. Laptop hard drives spin at 5500rpm and this slower speed coupled with the mechanical movement of read/write heads is what consumes the time. SSDs eliminate those factors. The read/write functions in an SSD are similar to those that take place in system RAM. Secondly, when doing any internal work on computers, especially laptops, remember to disconnect power and remove the battery. And just FYI, I run an SSD in my Windows 10 Pro desktop. It takes about 7 seconds from the time I turn on the computer until I am looking at my desktop. Finally, a last word about SSDs - If you system uses IDE drives, then you will not see any great improvement in speed. The limiting factor in IDEs is the electronics itself. Be sure to check your existing drives to be SATA drives if you are looking for performance. Having said that, I put an IDE SSD in my old Dell 10 inch netbook. I did this to ensure drive reliability and reduce power consumption. While the performance increase is tiny, it is noticeable. A word about my computers and Windows 7 - Microsoft is no longer supporting Windows 7, although it does update Windows 7 service pack 1 to what the latest was at the time of pulling support. My rationale is simple: Windows 7 runs fast on my two older laptops. Both laptops will actually run Windows 10, but the netbook maxes out at 2gb of RAM and the Toshiba at 4gb of RAM. Windows 10 Pro runs best with at least 8gb of RAM, so I get stuck with performance issues and some driver issues when using Windows 10 on these two laptops. Another alternative is to run Linux on these two laptops. Linux has a long reputation of re-energizing older computers. I recommend Linux Mint.",

      "content": "I bought these drives to replace the disc-type (and now old) hard drives in my Dell Mini 1011 net books. While Windows XP is long past being supported (or even usable), these netbooks make great Linux machines (I'm using several Ubuntu variants at this point; 18.04 is the last 32-bit OS which is what these netbooks need). Anyway, one of the Q&A for this product made the claim that these SSDs will work in the Dell Mini 1011. NO, THEY DON'T. While you can install an OS to the SSD the netbook will not boot up post-installation stating that the OS is missing. The issue, as I found out AFTER buying these SSDs, is that the Kingston A400 is backwards compatible to SATA II only (and not SATA I as the Mini requires; Kingston claims these will work in drives from 2008 and onwards, but apparently, though the Mini 1011 was introduced in 2009 it still used SATA I). This was a major disappointment as these Kingston A400s are great SSDs offered at a great price. Turns out SSDs for older machines like this Mini is a bit of a mine field. I have a KingData 64GB SSD (Amazon ASIN: B08J3PTFPV) in one of my Dell Minis and it works fine (it's a SATA III SSD that is compatible backwards to SATA I). Given what I wanted to use another Mini for, using another KingData SSD was out of the question as I wasn't going to trust a relatively unknown Chinese company with sensitive data in light of the many misbehaviors by Chinese black hat hackers (official and otherwise). Hence, why I tried to go with this Kingston; it's a name I trust. In the end, not sure if I'll return these Kingston SSDs. Maybe I'll find some other use for them. As for my Mini netbooks project I went with some Crucial BX500 SSDs (Amazon ASIN: B07G3KRZBY). I'm spending more than I wanted to (why I thought these Kingston A400s were a great choice), but Crucial is another name I trust. Bottom line, yes, this is more of a review of a project than the Kingston SSD. But I wanted to write this because there are many people who continue to play with these Dell Mini netbooks (a niche somewhat like the Raspberry Pi community) and I wanted these folks to know that this SSD does NOT work in the Mini 1011 (and earlier. Though maybe yes with the Mini 1012 (though I lean toward thinking no)). Kingston A400 SSD: 5 stars. Kingston A400 SSD in a Dell Mini 1011: 0 stars.",

      "content": "got the 256GB SATA drive, and it's by far the best value SSD out there that I could find. Performance-wise it might not be the fastest, but for my needs (and on my old motherboard which only gets SATA I speeds anyway) it is perfect. Excellent customer service from the company, too. I thought I had a problem with the first one I received (in hindsight it was probably working just fine) and the company sent a new one super fast, no hassle at all. With my Windows 10 now on the SSD, it feels like a new machine. Installation tips: I am not a hardware or computer expert and do not profess to be, and I did the installation myself on a desktop and learned a lot in the process (mostly through Google and message boards). This isn't a detailed installation guide, just a few tips I learned. So here's how you can learn from my mistakes and avoid some frustration: 1. If your computer doesn't see your drive, and you can't see the drive in disk management or in BIOS, go into BIOS and make sure your SATA ports are not disabled. I had this issue and took me forever to realize this was the problem. In hindsight it should have been obvious, but I was learning my way through all this so I didn't think of it. 2. You will also likely need to go into BIOS and make sure your SATA operation is set to AHCI. BUT (and this is important) if your settings are not on AHCI and you switch to them in BIOS, you will get a blue screen on startup and crash. You will need to use the command prompt (as admin) first to ensure a startup in safe mode by typing \"bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal\", THEN restart and go into BIOS, switch over to AHCI, restart in safe mode, and go back into command prompt as admin, type \"bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot\", restart again, and you will be all set. After doing that, I was finally able to see both drives in the boot order. 3. If you want to move your Windows OS from an existing drive to your SSD, you can try to clone it and maybe you'll have no problem, but after trying multiple clones with different programs and having them fail every time, I finally just did a fresh install of windows from a USB (or other media device) and was glad I did. Don't waste your time with cloning and just do the fresh install. It could save you countless hours of frustration. I don't know if that will help anyone or not, but I hope it will. And if that all sounds WAY too complicated to you, find a friend who is well versed in computer hardware, buy them a case of their favorite beer, and plead with them to do the installation for you.",

Not even with the SATA NVMe connection. Just not going work. I'm lucky enough to discover that the latest 2.78 BIOS update actually allows PCIe to be detected and usable via the SATA NVMe portion (M or M+B key). * Will NOT work if you're depending on the PCIe NVME M.2 as the primary boot up because it's faster for systems that utiliz old BIOS. Not going to happen. You MUST have the M or M+B Key SATA as the primary boot at max of 500MB/s read-write rate. * If you're purchasing for very old systems that don't have UEFI boot mode at bare minimum that supports PCIe NVMe, you're gambling with your money. With those warnings in mind, overall, the addon is quite awesome. Going from the SATA III with read-write at 120MB/s max, loading up at 500MB/s beats the old SATA III HHDs hands down. Paired up with M.2 500GB or 1TB, the system renewed with a new life to do light photoshopping/video editing for beginners as the read-write max out at 3282 MB/s. My old HDDs would have disk throttled at 90% to 100% constantly. With these additions, the HDD remains constant at 0% or max at 10% (for the booting SATA NVMe). Kids play games, and no hangup or bottlenecking like it was under the common SATA HDD. Compared to SSD and the old HDD temperature, SSD peaking out at 44C while the HDD roasts at 58C after 60 minutes. The provided silicone strips and radiating fins help with the temperature dissipation and maintained at 36C after 60 minutes.  Not a bad deal.",

      "content": "I bought this SSD drive as a replacement for the hard drive of my Dell Inspiron 15 5559 laptop computer, which I bought in 2016. The original hard drive crashed some months ago, and I lost EVERYTHING in the Documents folder.  Thankfully, I was able to rescue the other documents.  I think the drive may have gotten damaged during a flight I took in February. I'm not a particularly 'technical' person, but I watched a couple of YouTube videos and decided to replace the drive myself. I had never opened a laptop before. Suffice it to say, I was a little nervous. It was not as easy as the technicians made it look on YouTube, but I managed to make it work. One of the screw holes in the replacement drive didn't quite line up with the existing frame that the defective drive was removed from, and for about half an hour I thought I was going to have to replace the frame itself, which would have been quite inconvenient as I live in rural Jamaica and I'm not sure I would have been able to find one locally. To be honest, I may have damaged the frame myself by bending it while removing the other drive but I'm not sure.  Thankfully, I was able to force the replacement drive into place without damaging it. It has been approximately three weeks since I replaced the drive with this one and I am VERY pleased. I guess anything would have been better than a hard drive that failed, rendering the computer useless for several months, but this particular purchase has thus far been very worth the money. The storage capacity is much less, because I couldn't afford more GB at this time, but I cannot complain about the SPEED of this drive. It opens programs so much more quickly than the other one. Granted, my previous drive was bought in August 2016. With the OLD drive, it took a few seconds to open Microsoft Word, PPT, etc. With the replacement drive, if I accidentally click on the Word icon in the taskbar and the program starts to open, I am simply not fast enough to press the X on the box that comes up to close the program. It opens too quickly! NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING. I'm not! That alone makes me super happy with this purchase. Thus far, I am very pleased.",

      "content": "I've been fixing PCs for 35+ yrs.  I've probably forgotten more about PCs (DIP switches, IRQs, DMA addresses) than most Geek Squad techs learned. I've been an avid Linux user for 10 yrs. now (although I fix more Windows problems of course). This Kingston SSD drive is a fantastic value.  Yes, I prefer Samsung, WD, Sandisk for higher capacities.  However, for smaller capacities, I love this Kingston.  The outer plastic encased material is more durable than the competitors.  This SSD works just fine. The drive can be formatted for MBR or GPT and it installs Ubuntu or MX Linux just fine either way. From the information S. Carpenter provides, I can surmise a few problems w/ his setup: 1. His system boots UEFI.  Therefore it MUST boot from a GPT hdd/ssd. 2. His Kingston SSD is formatted for MBR.  Therefore his system CANNOT boot from it. His EASY EASY fix is to reformat the Kingston SSD to GPT, leave it empty, and then install his fave Linux distro on it. Unfortunately, Mr. Carpenter doesn't have the common sense to google his problem before mouthing off to the world about \"the\" problem with Kingston, when it's actually \"his\" problem with his limited computer expertise. BTW, I loved this Kingston SSD that I've bought 6 of them in order to revive older PCs. Before buying, I would check the prices and calculate the $/GB.  The prices seem to fluctuate a lot lately.  Like I said, I do prefer the other brands at higher capacities, but at lower capacities (and lower prices), this product can't be beat. FYI, I did test the WD EasyShare SSDs, available exclusively at BestBuy.  WD tries to price it identically to the Kingston, but in my benchmarks, reads are on par but writes as 2-3x slower.  Nice try WD, but no medal for you.",

It's for music/videos/some Steam games. The NVME has Windows installed. The attached screenshots are speedtests while it's still quite empty-only about 130GB is in use here. The speedtests are quite good. Actually, when you consider the price they're great. Sequential speeds come close to saturating the SATA III bus which is nice. On the right, you'll see that the drives S.M.A.R.T statistics reported a nearly new drive-although it indicates it's been powered on 8 times which was strange..this was the first time I had powered the drive up after partitioning. On setup: This drive comes blank, obviously. It needs to be partitioned then formatted & assigned a drive letter so you can use it. My OS wasn't stored stored here-but if your using this as a boot drive, obviously you'll need to install Windows to it at this point. This is a GREAT drive for an older PC, or for secondary storage or use for extra games. The bad: This is a DRAMless SSD. So, when writing large large amounts of data to it for long periods of time it will slow a bit. This has no effect on read speeds though and unless your in video/music production your unlikely to even notice. It doesn't show in speed tests, it shows in extended operation during file copy for example (when the file is greater than 30GB+) But for $30? Pretty good.",

      "title": "Big Improvements for the $",
      "content": "PRODUCT: Kingston A400 120GB SSD SUMMARY: This drive is a great deal for improved performance if you don't need a whole lot of space. It\u2019s top-notch for an entry-level SSD, but because of how bare-bones it is, you might need to be prepared for a very slightly more difficult process to set this up than with some other popular SSD choices. MY SITUATION: I\u2019m not precisely an IT professional, but I do deal with all the tech for the small business I work for, and I\u2019d rank my IT skills as medium-high. I'm working on updating the computers in an office with 16 employees, and with most of the computers needing a boost in speed, it's great to be able to buy several of these for a good price. The vast majority of our work documents are stored in shared locations, so none of our computers need a whole lot of space\u2014our staff are generally only using 50-70GB on their drives for the OS and a pretty standard array of programs, so 120GB is the perfect size for us. Because most of our computers are at least three years old, the hardware only supports SATA II, so we're not seeing the huge improvement in speed that we might if we were going from HDDs to upper-limit SATA III speeds, but regardless, speeds have more than doubled in the four computers I've swapped these into so far, and users are seeing improvements, particularly in startup speeds for the computer (from more than 3 minutes down to 30 seconds) and for individual programs. See images for CrystalDisk comparison before and after on one of the machines. I'll post an update once I put together the brand new build I'm about to do with one of these. ISSUES IN THE PROCESS: I did run into a couple of issues that threw me off while installing these. The first was that the drive would not show up after hooking it up in the case and rebooting. It didn\u2019t show in This PC or in Computer Management. The solution was to run Windows Memory Diagnostic, which is easily found through the start menu and took maybe 5-10 minutes to run on the two computers that had this issue. After that, I was able to see the disk in Computer Management, and I GPT partitioned each of the drives from there. See pieced together image for visuals on the process for getting this settled. The other slight hiccup I had was the computer refusing to boot from the drive once I removed the old HDD; this was easily resolved by changing the boot mode in the BIOS from Legacy to UEFI, which was necessary because I had partitioned them all as GPT. OTHER NOTES: I planned on mounting all of these with some heavy-duty Velcro we have lying around the office, which I\u2019ve heard several places is fine because SSDs don\u2019t have moving parts, so they don\u2019t need to be held super-steady, and skipping a mounting bracket saved about $6 per drive (which is nice when buying several). The Velcro is doing just fine for three of the drives, and the fourth computer, conveniently, had a hot-swap bay with a 3.5 slot on one side (where the old HDD was), and a 2.5 spot on the other side that worked perfectly with some spare screws from the last case I bought.",

After enabling \"boot from SSD\" in the Pi's raspi-config utility, I plugged the SSD into one of the USB 3.0 Pi ports, rebooted the Pi, and it discovered and mounted the SSD just fine. I can't say what kind of transfer rates I get through the Pi's USB 3.0 port, but when I put the image on the SSD with the Win 10 PC through a USB 3.0 port, I saw a little over 300 MB/s write, and 160 MB/s read speeds.
